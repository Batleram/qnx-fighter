RaspberryPi GPIO for QNX
========================

This repository contains multiple component that can be used to interact with
the GPIOs on a RaspberryPi board under QNX:

* `resmgr`: The `rpi_gpio` resource manager is a server that provides access to
  GPIOs to client programs.
* `python`: Python shared libraries that provide a familiar API.
* `gpioctrl`: A graphical UI
